# chicken 

a Haskell parser for my Toggl checkins

## How to use

Just pass it to the command-line:

```sh
chicken path/to/toggle-report.csv
```

And you'll get

```sh
# TODO: Sample output
```

## FAQ

- **This looks cool, can I use it?** Sure, but this uses the arcane Haskell
    tech stack. I included the installation instructions above so you can just
    follow them. However, I prefer that you use
    [thinkingmachines/toggl-checkin](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/toggl-checkin)
- **Why are you making this if there's already an extension?** For fun, and because I
    live in the terminal! Also I'm learning Haskell so why not make something
    useful out of it?  
- **Can I contribute to this tool?** Sure! But this is really a super internal
    tool and you might be better off contributing to my other open-source work!
